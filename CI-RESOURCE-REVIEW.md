# CI resource review status

This branch adds explicit resource budgets to the repository-owned build path. The sizing remains provisional until representative Tekton runs are measured after cluster recovery.

Review validation: `git diff --check $(git merge-base origin/HEAD HEAD)..HEAD` passes locally. Tekton execution is intentionally deferred while cluster Kubernetes API reads are failing. A skipped or neutral PaC status is not a successful test. Before merge or rollout acceptance, run the repository pipeline individually and record duration, per-container CPU, memory and ephemeral-storage peaks, throttling, OOM/eviction and scheduling outcomes; revise budgets if measurements require it.

The final documentation commit carries `[skip tkn]` to defer this PR's automatic build. Pipeline definitions, trigger matching and security gates remain enabled.

2026-10-09 API review correction: Tekton v1 Step budgets use `computeResources`;
PVC storage keeps its Kubernetes `resources` field. The installed Task v1
Step schema rejected the previous Step key and accepts the corrected definitions.
Budgets remain provisional pending controlled runtime sampling. [skip tkn]
